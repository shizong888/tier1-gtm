# Token Incentives and Governance

Tier 1's incentive and governance system is designed to align liquidity providers, traders, and long-term participants around execution quality and market health. Incentives are used to reward productive activity, not speculative behavior, ensuring that growth in trading volume directly improves liquidity depth, execution quality, and network resilience.

The FT1 token sits at the center of this system, linking trading activity, liquidity provision, and governance participation into a single, self-reinforcing economic loop.

## FT1 - Core Utility and Governance

FT1 governs protocol-level economics and incentive routing.

- Participants earn points through verified trading activity, liquidity provision, and protocol usage
- Points convert into FT1 allocation over time, aligning early contributors with long-term network ownership
- FT1 holders participate in governance decisions related to incentive allocation, market structure parameters, and protocol upgrades

This structure ensures that contributors who improve execution quality and liquidity are directly rewarded with ownership and influence.

## Incentive Market — Productive Governance

Tier 1's governance framework is designed to direct incentives toward markets and behaviors that measurably improve execution quality.

- Governance participants allocate incentives based on spread quality, depth, uptime, and volume sustainability
- Markets that deliver tighter spreads and deeper liquidity receive increased incentive weighting
- Incentives decay as markets mature, reducing reliance on subsidies over time

This makes governance outcome-driven rather than theoretical, with incentives flowing toward productive activity instead of wash volume.

## Long-Term Alignment and Participation

Tier 1 encourages long-term alignment between active contributors and the protocol.

- Governance participation rewards sustained engagement rather than short-term activity spikes
- Incentives favor consistent liquidity provision, active trading, and protocol contribution
- Early participants who help establish market quality maintain influence as the network scales

This converts individual trading and liquidity activity into durable, protocol-level alignment.

## Treasury and Incentive Deployment

Tier 1's treasury is deployed to support market quality and network growth.

- Incentives are allocated dynamically based on network conditions and liquidity needs
- Treasury deployment prioritizes execution improvements over pure user acquisition
- As liquidity stabilizes, incentive intensity is reduced and reallocated toward infrastructure and ecosystem growth

This ensures incentives strengthen the execution layer rather than distort market behavior.

## Feedback Loop

Productive trading activity →

Deeper liquidity and tighter spreads →

Improved execution quality →

Higher trader retention and volume →

Increased protocol fees and data →

Governance directs incentives toward high-performing markets →

Further improvements in liquidity and execution

Tier 1's incentive system is designed to evolve over time. Early-stage, points-based and airdrop incentives are used to bootstrap liquidity and verify real participation, and naturally taper as markets mature. Long-term staking rewards, fee sharing, and governance remain core components of the protocol, ensuring sustained alignment once execution quality becomes self-sustaining.
