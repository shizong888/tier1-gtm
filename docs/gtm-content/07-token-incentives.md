# Token Incentives and Governance

Tier 1's incentive system is designed to verify real contribution, not subsidize volume. Points programs, FT1 allocation, and governance participation are tied to measurable execution quality and sustained participation—not wash trading or short-term extraction.

## FT1 - Core Utility and Governance

**What it does:** FT1 governs protocol economics, incentive allocation, and market structure parameters. Token holders align with long-term network health through governance participation.

**How it's allocated:**
- Participants earn points through verified trading volume, liquidity provision, and protocol usage
- Points convert to FT1 based on sustained contribution (30+ day activity windows)
- Early contributors who improve execution quality receive higher allocation weights

**KPIs:**
- 60%+ of FT1 allocated to users active >90 days
- Governance participation rate >30% of token holders
- Incentive allocation votes aligned with execution quality metrics

**GTM execution:**
- Launch points dashboard showing real-time accrual (month 1)
- Publish FT1 allocation framework pre-launch (month 0)
- First governance vote on incentive allocation (month 6)

**So what for GTM:** FT1 aligns long-term contributors with protocol success. Use points to reward quality over volume—wash traders get filtered out by sustained activity requirements.

## Incentive Market - Productive Governance

**What it does:** Governance directs incentives toward markets and participants that measurably improve execution quality, not just generate volume.

**How it works:**
- Governance allocates incentives based on spread quality, depth, uptime, and sustained liquidity
- Markets with tighter spreads and deeper books receive higher incentive weights
- Incentives decay as markets mature and become self-sustaining

**KPIs:**
- Incentive efficiency: $ spent per $ of sustained liquidity
- 80%+ of incentives go to markets with <10bps spreads
- Incentive taper schedule adherence (50% reduction by month 18)
- Organic volume growth rate month-over-month

**GTM execution:**
- Deploy initial incentives to flagship markets (BTC, ETH, SOL) at launch
- Publish transparent incentive allocation dashboard (month 2)
- First governance reallocation based on execution metrics (month 6)
- Begin incentive taper once organic liquidity >$50M (month 12)

**So what for GTM:** Incentives are a bootstrapping tool, not a permanent subsidy. Measure efficiency ruthlessly—dollars spent per dollar of sustained liquidity is the scoreboard.

## Long-Term Alignment and Participation

**What it does:** Rewards sustained engagement and quality contribution over short-term activity spikes.

**How it works:**
- Points multipliers for users active >30, 90, 180 days
- Early participants who establish market quality maintain higher influence
- Governance rewards consistent liquidity provision and active trading

**KPIs:**
- 70%+ of active users have >30-day history
- 50%+ of FT1 allocated to users active >90 days
- Churn rate <30% for users with 90+ day history
- Organic referral rate >20% of new signups

**GTM execution:**
- Implement tiered points multipliers at launch (1.5x for 30-day, 2x for 90-day users)
- Publish leaderboards showing sustained contributors (month 3)
- Launch referral program with long-term participant rewards (month 6)

**So what for GTM:** Retention > acquisition. Reward quality participation, not volume spikes. Long-term users become advocates and organic growth drivers.

## Treasury and Incentive Deployment

**What it does:** Treasury deploys incentives dynamically based on network conditions, liquidity needs, and execution quality metrics.

**How it works:**
- Incentives allocated to markets with strongest execution improvements
- Treasury deployment prioritizes execution quality over raw user acquisition
- As liquidity stabilizes, incentives taper and reallocate to infrastructure/ecosystem growth

**KPIs:**
- Incentive budget utilization vs. plan (track monthly burn rate)
- ROI on incentive spend ($ incentives per $ sustained liquidity)
- % of treasury allocated to execution improvements vs. marketing
- Incentive taper milestones: 25% reduction by month 12, 50% by month 18

**GTM execution:**
- Deploy 40% of incentive budget to Phase 1 (MM liquidity programs)
- Deploy 35% to Phase 2 (active trader acquisition and retention)
- Deploy 25% to Phase 3 (retail onboarding and referral schemes)
- Monthly treasury reviews to adjust allocation based on execution metrics

**So what for GTM:** Treasury is finite. Allocate to execution quality first, distribution second. Measure ROI on every dollar spent—incentives should taper as organic growth kicks in.

## Referral and Community Growth Programs

**What it does:** Rewards community advocates who drive quality user acquisition, not vanity metrics.

**How it works:**
- Referral programs incentivize acquisition based on referred users' real trading activity
- Community ambassadors earn rewards tied to engagement depth and retention, not raw signups
- Tiered structures reward long-term advocates with sustained network contribution

**KPIs:**
- Referred users with >30-day retention: 50%+
- Referral-driven signups as % of total: 20%+
- Top 10% of referrers driving 50%+ of referral volume
- Ambassador program participants >100 by month 12

**GTM execution:**
- Soft-launch referral program with 20-30 community advocates (month 3)
- Public referral program launch with tiered rewards (month 6)
- Ambassador program with co-marketing and exclusive access (month 9)
- Leaderboards and rewards for top referrers (ongoing)

**So what for GTM:** Organic growth via trusted advocates scales better than paid acquisition. Reward quality referrals (users who trade and stick around), not spam.

Productive trading activity →
Deeper liquidity and tighter spreads →
Improved execution quality →
Higher trader retention and volume →
Increased protocol fees and data →
Governance directs incentives toward high-performing markets →
Further improvements in liquidity and execution

## Incentive Allocation by Phase

**Phase 1 (Months 0-3): Liquidity Foundation**
- 40% of budget to MM liquidity programs
- Target: $15M+ depth, <10bps spreads
- Success metric: Sustained MM commitment >90 days

**Phase 2 (Months 3-9): Trader Validation**
- 35% of budget to trader acquisition and retention
- Target: 300+ active traders, 60%+ retention
- Success metric: Organic volume growth >30% month-over-month

**Phase 3 (Months 9-18): Retail Scale**
- 25% of budget to retail onboarding and referral schemes
- Target: 8,000+ monthly active retail, 50%+ 90-day retention
- Success metric: NPS >40, referral-driven signups >20%

**Taper schedule:**
- Month 12: Reduce incentive budget by 25%
- Month 18: Reduce by 50%
- Month 24: Incentives primarily for new market bootstrapping

**So what for GTM:** Incentives are a tool, not a strategy. Measure efficiency, reward quality, taper as organic growth kicks in. Every dollar spent should be tied to a KPI—no vanity metrics, no volume subsidies.
