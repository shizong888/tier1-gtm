# Network Effects and Compounding Liquidity

Tier 1's network effects are measurable, not theoretical. Each feedback loop ties to specific KPIs and GTM execution. Once liquidity crosses threshold depth, growth becomes self-sustaining.

## Liquidity Loop

**Mechanism:**
Professional MMs deploy capital into deterministic, low-latency markets →
Spreads compress 20-40%, depth increases 30-60% →
Active traders measure better fills vs. CEXs →
Higher volume improves LP returns and incentive efficiency →
More MMs join, liquidity deepens further →
Cycle compounds

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Spread compression: Target <10bps on majors (vs. 15-25bps CEX baseline)
- Depth increase: $15M+ at top of book → $50M+ by month 12
- LP returns: 15-25% APY from fees + incentives in Phase 1, 10-15% APY by Phase 3 (as incentives taper)
- MM count growth: 6 at launch → 12-15 by month 12

**KPIs:**
- Spread compression %
- Depth at top of book ($M)
- LP return on capital (%)
- MM count and uptime

**GTM implication:** Liquidity quality is the moat. Track spread compression ruthlessly—if spreads aren't measurably better than CEXs by month 6, retail expansion won't work.

**So what for GTM:** Publish real-time execution dashboard showing spreads vs. CEX benchmarks. Use data to validate GTM narrative: "Tightest spreads in crypto, provably on-chain."

## Execution Trust Loop

**Mechanism:**
Transparent on-chain execution rules produce predictable outcomes →
Traders verify fills, liquidations, funding independently →
Trust replaces reliance on opaque CEX intermediaries →
Increased confidence drives sustained trading activity →
More data reinforces execution credibility →
Cycle compounds

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Liquidation fairness: <2% unfair liquidations (vs. 8-12% CEX average)
- Execution transparency: 100% of fills verifiable on-chain
- Trust metrics: NPS >40 by Phase 3, >60% of traders report higher trust vs. CEXs
- Independent audits: 3rd-party execution audit published month 6

**KPIs:**
- Unfair liquidation rate (%)
- NPS score
- % traders reporting higher trust (survey)
- Independent audit publication

**GTM implication:** Trust is measurable. Track liquidation fairness, publish on-chain proof, commission independent audits. Use transparency as differentiation vs. CEXs.

**So what for GTM:** Liquidation fairness becomes a GTM wedge for retail. "No discretionary liquidations—rules are on-chain, verifiable by anyone."

## Trader Adoption Loop

**Mechanism:**
Institutional-grade execution attracts active traders →
Active traders generate $50M+ daily volume and market data →
Retail benefits from tighter spreads and improved liquidity →
Retail participation increases volume without degrading execution →
Broader participation reinforces market depth →
Cycle compounds

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Trader growth: 50 active traders (month 3) → 300 (month 9) → 1,000+ (month 12)
- Volume growth: $5M daily (month 3) → $50M (month 9) → $200M+ OI (month 12)
- Retention: 60%+ 30-day retention, 50%+ 90-day retention
- Organic referrals: 20%+ of signups by Phase 2

**KPIs:**
- Active trader count
- Daily notional volume ($M)
- Daily open interest ($M)
- 30-day and 90-day cohort retention (%)
- Organic referral rate (%)

**GTM implication:** Retention drives growth. Track cohort retention ruthlessly—if 30-day retention <50%, fix onboarding and UX before scaling acquisition.

**So what for GTM:** Organic referrals are the leading indicator of product-market fit. If traders aren't referring friends by month 6, execution quality isn't differentiated enough.

---

## Governance and Incentive Loop

**Mechanism:**
Trading activity generates protocol fees and on-chain data →
Governance allocates incentives to markets with best execution metrics (spreads, depth, uptime) →
Incentives reinforce productive liquidity and trading behavior →
Market quality improves →
Higher-quality markets attract additional activity →
Cycle compounds

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Incentive efficiency: $ spent per $ of sustained liquidity improves 30-50% as organic volume grows
- Governance participation: 30%+ of FT1 holders vote on incentive allocation
- Incentive taper: 25% reduction by month 12, 50% by month 18
- Organic volume %: 40% of volume unsubsidized by month 12, 70%+ by month 18

**KPIs:**
- Incentive efficiency ($ incentives per $ liquidity)
- Governance participation rate (%)
- % of volume that is organic (unsubsidized)
- Incentive budget burn rate vs. plan

**GTM implication:** Incentives must taper as organic growth kicks in. If organic volume % isn't increasing month-over-month, GTM is too reliant on subsidies.

**So what for GTM:** Track organic volume growth as % of total. If still <30% by month 12, product-market fit is weak—don't scale retail until organic growth improves.

## Infrastructure and Ecosystem Loop

**Mechanism:**
Execution quality attracts ecosystem integrations (UIs, wallets, analytics) →
Integrations improve accessibility, tooling, and user experience →
Better tooling increases trader efficiency and participation →
Higher participation improves market depth and data quality →
Tier 1 becomes default execution layer for on-chain trading →
Cycle compounds

**Measurable outcomes:**
- Partner integrations: 5 by month 6 → 15 by month 12 → 25 by month 18
- Partner-driven volume: 15% by month 9 → 30%+ by month 12
- Partner-driven signups: 500/month by month 9 → 1,000+/month by month 12
- Analytics integrations: 3+ (Dune, Nansen, DefiLlama) by month 12

**KPIs:**
- Partner integration count
- % volume routed via partners
- Partner-driven user acquisition (signups/month)
- Analytics platform integrations

**GTM implication:** Partners amplify distribution. Track partner-driven volume and signups—if <20% by month 12, partner program isn't working.

**So what for GTM:** Partner integrations create ecosystem lock-in. Prioritize integrations that bring high-intent users (prop platforms, execution-focused UIs, active trader wallets).

## Cumulative Impact and Escape Velocity

**Threshold metrics for self-sustaining growth:**
- $50M+ depth at top of book
- <10bps spreads on flagship markets
- 300+ active traders with 60%+ 30-day retention
- 30%+ organic volume (unsubsidized)
- 20%+ signups from organic referrals
- 5+ ecosystem integrations driving 30%+ of volume

**When these thresholds are hit (target: month 12):**
- Liquidity becomes self-sustaining (MMs profitable without subsidies)
- Execution quality becomes a durable moat (best on-chain spreads)
- Incentives naturally taper (organic growth > subsidized growth)
- Trust replaces marketing as primary growth driver

**GTM phase shift at escape velocity:**
- Phase 1-2: High-touch, manual acquisition (BSO, prop platforms, KOLs)
- Phase 3+: Distribution at scale (wallet integrations, partners, referrals)
- Post-escape: Product-led growth, ecosystem expansion, new market launches

## Network Effect Measurement Dashboard

**Leading indicators (months 0-6):**
- MM commitment depth and uptime
- Spread compression vs. CEXs
- Active trader retention and organic referrals
- Execution quality audit results

**Lagging indicators (months 6-12):**
- Total depth and volume growth
- Retail adoption and NPS
- Partner integration velocity
- Organic volume as % of total

**Escape velocity indicators (month 12+):**
- Self-sustaining LP profitability
- Incentive taper adherence
- Partner-driven volume >30%
- NPS >60, organic referrals >30%

---

**So what for GTM:** Network effects are the endgame, not the starting point. Build liquidity first, validate execution second, scale distribution third. Track leading indicators obsessively—they predict whether lagging metrics will hit targets. Once escape velocity is reached, GTM becomes product-led growth + ecosystem expansion.
