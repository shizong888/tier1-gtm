# Target Audience

Tier 1 is designed as an execution-first trading venue that serves multiple participant types through a single, transparent market structure. Unlike centralized exchanges, where execution advantages are opaque and unevenly distributed, Tier 1 provides deterministic, on-chain execution rules that apply equally to all participants, while enabling latency-sensitive strategies that cannot operate on existing on-chain venues.

This architecture positions Tier 1 as a shared execution layer where institutional liquidity and retail participation reinforce one another, rather than compete.
