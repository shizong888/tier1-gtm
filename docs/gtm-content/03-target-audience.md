# Target Audience

Tier 1 is designed as an execution-first trading venue that serves multiple participant types through a single, transparent market structure. Unlike centralized exchanges, where execution advantages are opaque and unevenly distributed, Tier 1 provides deterministic, on-chain execution rules that apply equally to all participants, while enabling latency-sensitive strategies that cannot operate on existing on-chain venues.

This architecture positions Tier 1 as a shared execution layer where institutional liquidity and retail participation reinforce one another, rather than compete.

## Primary Audience Segments

### 1. Liquidity Providers and Market Makers

Professional market makers, proprietary trading firms, and quantitative funds that require:

- Ultra-low-latency and deterministic execution
- Predictable queue positioning and execution outcomes
- The ability to deploy latency-sensitive strategies on-chain
- Transparent fee structures and verifiable execution rules

Tier 1 enables these participants to provide consistent, high-quality liquidity without the opaque internalization and discretionary matching common on centralized exchanges.

Deeper professional liquidity tightens spreads and improves execution quality, which increases trading volume and attracts additional liquidity providers.

### 2. Active Traders and Power Retail

Sophisticated retail traders and active market participants who are most sensitive to:

- Tight spreads and low slippage
- Predictable execution during volatile conditions
- Fair and transparent market structure
- Reliable liquidation mechanics

These traders benefit directly from the presence of professional liquidity and deterministic execution, which reduces adverse selection and execution uncertainty compared to existing venues.

<div class="gtm-positive-loop">
Improved execution outcomes increase trader retention and volume, reinforcing liquidity depth and market quality.
</div>

### 3. Broader Retail Traders

Retail participants seeking access to deep, liquid markets with transparent execution, without needing to understand or compete on latency.

Retail access is intentionally expanded after liquidity and execution quality are established, ensuring that retail traders enter a market with institutional-grade depth rather than incentive-driven, thin liquidity.

Retail participation is supported by:

- Transparent, on-chain execution and price discovery
- Points-based incentive programs that reward productive trading behavior
- Clear liquidation mechanics and predictable outcomes

<div class="gtm-positive-loop">
Retail volume further deepens liquidity, improves price discovery, and strengthens the overall trading environment.
</div>

- Wallets, custody solutions, and institutional access providers  
- Risk engines, margin tools, and liquidation infrastructure  
- Data and market intelligence providers  
- Lending and capital efficiency protocols  
- Prediction markets and derivatives built on Tier 1 liquidity  
- Funded prop trading platforms offering trader evaluation and capital allocation programs  

These partners benefit from:

- High-quality, on-chain execution and market data  
- Deep, professional liquidity with predictable execution behavior  
- Increased user activity driven by superior market quality  
- Integration with a transparent, institutional-grade execution layer
