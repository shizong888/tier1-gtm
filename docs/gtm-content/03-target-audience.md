# Target Audience

Tier 1 serves four participant groups in sequence: market makers (liquidity foundation), active traders (execution validation), retail (volume scale), and ecosystem partners (distribution). Each group enters through different channels but converges on the same deterministic execution layer.

## Primary Audience Segments

<div class="gtm-cards-grid">

## Liquidity Providers and Market Makers

**Profile:** 8-12 professional HFT shops, prop trading firms, and quant funds requiring sub-ms latency and deterministic fills.

**Acquisition channels:**
- BSO direct intros (primary)
- Institutional sales outreach to top 20 crypto MMs
- Pilot liquidity programs with tiered fee rebates

**What they need:**
- Colocation infrastructure with <1ms latency
- Transparent queue positioning and execution rules
- Verifiable on-chain fills and audit trails

**KPIs tied to this segment:**
- 6+ MMs providing continuous two-sided quotes
- $15M+ depth within 25bps across flagship markets
- 99.9%+ uptime for colocation infrastructure

**So what for GTM:** This segment IS the product. Without them, there's no execution quality to sell to traders. BSO partnership is our primary unlock here—target signed agreements with 3-4 MMs before public launch.

## Active Traders and Power Retail

**Profile:** 400-1,000 execution-sensitive traders: prop firms, funded account traders, power retail seeking better fills. These traders drive 70-80% of platform volume.

**Acquisition channels:**
- Partner platforms: funded prop trading programs (FTMO, TopStepTrader equivalents)
- KOL campaigns focused on execution transparency (CT influencers with 50K+ followers)
- CEX migration programs offering fee discounts + points multipliers
- Direct outreach to high-volume traders on competing venues

**What they need:**
- Tight spreads (<10bps on majors) and low slippage
- Transparent execution dashboards showing real-time metrics
- Points programs tied to sustained trading volume
- Reliable liquidation mechanics

**KPIs tied to this segment:**
- 600-1,000 active traders generating $150-300M daily notional
- 60%+ 30-day retention
- Average slippage <15bps for $50K trades
- 20%+ of new signups from organic referrals
- 70-80% of total platform volume from institutional/active traders

**So what for GTM:** This is the validation layer and primary volume driver. A few hundred highly active institutional traders generate more volume than thousands of casual retail users. Run 2-3 KOL campaigns in months 3-6, publish execution audit in month 6.

## Broader Retail Traders

**Profile:** 2,000-8,000 retail traders seeking fair access to deep liquidity without competing on latency. Retail contributes 20-30% of platform volume.

**Acquisition channels:**
- DEX aggregators and wallet integrations (MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby)
- KOL partnerships (CT influencers, YouTube educators)
- Referral schemes (tiered rewards for community advocates)
- Partner UIs and trading interfaces

**What they need:**
- Access to institutional-grade spreads without HFT competition
- Transparent on-chain liquidation rules
- Educational content explaining execution quality
- Points programs rewarding productive trading

**KPIs tied to this segment:**
- 2,000-8,000 monthly active retail traders
- $400-600M daily open interest
- <2% unfair liquidations (vs. 8-12% industry avg)
- 50%+ of retail active beyond 90 days
- NPS >40
- 20-30% of total platform volume from retail

**So what for GTM:** Retail scales once execution quality is proven. Launch wallet integrations in month 9, activate referral schemes in month 10. Retail story: "Trade where HFTs provide liquidity, not where they trade against you." Volume concentration matters more than user count—platform success comes from institutional participation.

## Ecosystem and Infrastructure Partners

**Profile:** Trading interfaces, analytics platforms, wallets, risk engines, and funded prop programs seeking high-quality execution data.

**Acquisition channels:**
- Direct BD outreach to top 10 perps UIs
- Integration partnerships with custody providers (Fireblocks, Copper)
- Co-marketing with analytics platforms (Nansen, Dune)
- Developer grants for tooling and infrastructure

**What they need:**
- High-quality on-chain execution data
- APIs and SDKs for seamless integration
- Shared incentives tied to real user activity

**KPIs tied to this segment:**
- 5+ partner integrations live by month 12
- 30%+ of volume routed through partner UIs
- Partner-driven user acquisition >1,000/month

**So what for GTM:** Partners amplify distribution without fragmenting liquidity. Prioritize integrations that bring high-intent users (prop platforms, execution-focused UIs). Launch partner program in month 6.

    MMs → tight spreads → active traders → volume → retail trust → ecosystem growth → more MMs.

**Sequencing matters:** MMs before traders, traders before retail, retail before broad ecosystem. Each phase proves value for the next. Incentives verify contribution at every step.
