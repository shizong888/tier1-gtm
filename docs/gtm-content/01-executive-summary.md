## Executive Summary

### Tier 1: Deterministic Execution Infrastructure for Crypto

Tier 1 is the first on-chain execution layer that combines sub-millisecond latency, physical colocation, and transparent matching rules to unlock institutional-grade liquidity while materially improving outcomes for all traders.

**The unlock:** Professional market makers need deterministic execution to deploy latency-sensitive strategies on-chain. Once deployed, their liquidity tightens spreads by 20-40% and reduces slippage by 30-60% vs. existing venues—benefiting retail directly.

**GTM strategy:** Build liquidity-first through HFT/MM partnerships, prove execution quality with active traders, then scale retail into proven markets. Incentives verify contribution, not volume.

## Three-Phase Rollout (0-18 Months)

### Phase 1: Liquidity Foundation (Months 0-3)

**Who:** 8-12 professional market makers and HFT shops via BSO intros + direct outreach

**What:** Colocation, deterministic queueing, transparent fee structures

**Channels:** BSO partnership, direct institutional sales, pilot liquidity programs

**KPIs:**

| Metric | Good Enough | Home Run |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Active MMs | 4-6 providing continuous two-sided quotes | 8-12 providing continuous two-sided quotes |
| Depth | $10-15M within 25bps of mid across 3-5 flagship markets | $20-30M within 25bps of mid across 3-5 flagship markets |
| Execution quality | <0.5% of trades with queue manipulation or irregularities | <0.1% of trades with queue manipulation or irregularities |
| Uptime | 99.9% for colocation infrastructure | 99.95%+ for colocation infrastructure |
| Spread compression | 15-25% vs. comparable venues | 30-40% vs. comparable venues |

**So what for GTM:** Liquidity quality becomes the wedge for trader acquisition in Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Active Trader Validation (Months 3-9)

**Who:** 200-500 execution-sensitive traders (prop firms, power retail, quant funds)

**What:** Early access, points tied to real volume, transparent execution metrics

**Channels:** Partner platforms (prop trading, funded accounts), KOL campaigns (execution-focused), CEX migration programs

**KPIs:**

| Metric | Good Enough | Home Run |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Active traders | 150-250 generating daily notional volume | 400-600 generating daily notional volume |
| Daily volume | $25-40M notional | $60-100M notional |
| Trader retention | 45-55% (30-day cohort) | 65-75% (30-day cohort) |
| Average slippage | <20bps for $50K trades | <10bps for $50K trades |
| Institutional volume | 30-40% of total volume | 50-60% of total volume |
| Organic referrals | 12-18% of new trader signups | 25-35% of new trader signups |

**So what for GTM:** Execution quality is now proven by third-party data; retail expansion becomes credible.

---

### Phase 3: Retail Scale (Months 9-18)

**Who:** 5,000-15,000 retail traders via partner UIs, wallets, and community channels

**What:** Access to institutional-grade liquidity, transparent liquidations, points programs

**Channels:** DEX aggregators, wallet integrations, KOL partnerships, referral schemes

**KPIs:**

| Metric | Good Enough | Home Run |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Monthly active retail | 3,000-5,000 traders | 10,000-15,000 traders |
| Daily open interest | $80-120M | $250-400M |
| Unfair liquidations | <5% (vs. 8-12% industry avg) | <2% (vs. 8-12% industry avg) |
| 90-day retention | 35-45% of retail traders | 55-70% of retail traders |
| Net Promoter Score | 25-35 | 45-60 |
| Partner-driven volume | 20-30% of total | 40-50% of total |

**So what for GTM:** Retail benefits from HFT liquidity (tighter spreads, better fills) without competing on latency. Retention becomes organic.

## Game Film: First 60 Days Post-Launch

**Week 1-2 (Liquidity Ignition):**
- Launch with 4-6 MMs colocated, 3 flagship markets (BTC, ETH, SOL perps)
- Target ranges: $8-12M depth at top of book, 5-8bps spreads
- Run internal stress tests simulating 10x volume spikes
- Success = <0.5% queue manipulation, deterministic fills under load, 99.9%+ uptime
- Failure = spreads blow out >15bps consistently, uptime <99.5%, or 2+ MMs pull quotes
- **Decision point:** If <3 MMs remain, spreads >20bps, or uptime drops below 99.5%, pause trader onboarding and fix infrastructure before proceeding

**Week 3-4 (Trader Validation):**
- Invite 50 power retail + 10 prop firms for early access
- Publish real-time execution dashboard (slippage, depth, uptime)
- Run 2-3 targeted experiments: fee discounts for high-frequency traders, points multipliers for sustained volume
- Target ranges: $3-7M daily volume from traders, 15-25bps avg slippage
- Success = traders report better fills vs. CEXs, <40% churn, positive qualitative feedback
- Failure = churn >60%, traders report worse execution than CEXs, or spreads degrade with volume
- **Decision point:** If trader feedback is negative or churn >60%, run focused interviews to identify execution issues before scaling further

**Week 5-8 (Iteration & Scaling):**
- Onboard 80-150 additional traders via partner platforms
- Launch first KOL campaign focused on execution transparency (target: 30-60 signups)
- Expand to 5-7 markets based on liquidity provider capacity
- Target ranges: $15-30M daily volume, 120-180 active traders
- Success = organic word-of-mouth begins, 1-2 partner platforms request integration, trader retention >50%
- Failure = volume plateaus <$20M, MMs reduce commitment, or partner platforms show no interest
- **Decision point:** If volume growth stalls or retention drops below 40%, pause scaling and focus on product improvements (execution quality, UX, fee structure)

**Week 9-12 (Retail Prep & Early Validation):**
- Publish third-party execution audit comparing Tier 1 vs. top 3 CEXs (target: measurably better spreads/slippage)
- Finalize wallet/UI integrations for retail onboarding (MetaMask, Phantom)
- Soft-launch referral program with 20-30 community advocates
- Begin inviting first 100-200 retail beta users
- Target ranges: Infrastructure tested for 800-1,200 concurrent users, retail beta waitlist 1,000-2,500
- Success = execution audit shows 15-25% better metrics than CEXs, retail beta has <50% churn, waitlist grows organically
- Failure = audit shows comparable or worse metrics, infrastructure cannot scale, or retail beta churn >70%
- **Decision point:** Only proceed to full retail launch if audit is positive and beta retention >30%. Otherwise, iterate on product-market fit with active traders.

**Week 13+ (Post-60 Day Trajectory Assessment):**
- Review cumulative KPIs vs. Phase 1 targets
- Assess: Are we on track for "good enough" Phase 1 exit criteria? (4-6 MMs, $10-15M depth, 99.9%+ uptime)
- If yes: Proceed to Phase 2 trader scaling
- If no: Extend Phase 1 focus, delay trader scaling, and address root causes (infrastructure, liquidity, or execution quality)

**How we decide what's working:**
- **Weekly KPI review:** Track MM count, depth, spreads, uptime, trader count, volume, retention
- **Bi-weekly qualitative feedback:** Direct interviews with top 10-20 traders to assess execution quality vs. CEXs
- **Monthly cohort analysis:** Measure 30-day retention by acquisition channel—kill underperforming channels
- **Go/no-go gates:** Each phase has clear minimum thresholds; if not met, we pause scaling and fix fundamentals

## Why Retail Wins on an HFT Venue

**Tighter spreads:** Professional MMs compete on price, compressing spreads 20-40% vs. venues without HFT liquidity. Retail saves on every trade.

**Better fills:** Deterministic queueing prevents front-running and preferential matching. Retail gets the same execution rules as institutions.

**Predictable liquidations:** Transparent on-chain rules eliminate discretionary liquidations common on CEXs. Retail knows exactly when and how positions unwind.

**No exit liquidity risk:** HFTs profit from spread capture, not directional bets against retail. Market structure aligns incentives—MMs earn from providing liquidity, not from trading against users.

**Uptime & resilience:** Colocation + L1 architecture targets 99.95%+ uptime (industry-leading). Retail avoids "system maintenance" during volatile moves.

### Retail Protection Mechanisms

Addressing Blockchange/CMT concerns about retail becoming exit liquidity:

**1. Transparent execution rules:**
- All matching logic is on-chain and verifiable
- No preferential routing or hidden rebates
- Retail can audit every fill independently

**2. Position size limits and progressive margin:**
- New retail accounts start with lower leverage limits (5-10x vs. 20x for institutions)
- Gradual increases based on trading history and risk management
- Prevents overleveraged positions that benefit liquidation hunters

**3. Liquidation protection:**
- Partial liquidations (reduce position incrementally vs. full liquidation)
- Time-weighted average price (TWAP) liquidation execution to reduce slippage
- Liquidation penalty caps (maximum 2-3% vs. 10-15% on some CEXs)
- Real-time margin warnings and auto-deleverage options before liquidation threshold

**4. UX and education:**
- In-app execution quality dashboard showing real-time spreads, slippage, and liquidation fairness vs. CEXs
- Educational content explaining how HFT liquidity benefits retail (tighter spreads) vs. harms them (on venues with toxic order flow)
- Transparent fee structure with no hidden charges

**5. Market integrity monitoring:**
- Real-time detection of wash trading, spoofing, and layering
- Automatic flagging and review of suspicious liquidation patterns
- Monthly transparency reports showing liquidation fairness metrics

**6. Incentive alignment:**
- Points programs reward sustained trading, not volume spikes
- Referral rewards tied to referred users' retention, not just signups
- Long-term participants earn governance influence (FT1 allocation)

**Why this works:** HFTs on Tier 1 are liquidity providers, not predatory traders. They profit from spread capture and volume, not from liquidating retail. Transparent rules and position protections ensure retail isn't disadvantaged while still benefiting from institutional-grade liquidity.

**Good enough (fundable but not optimal):**
- 4-6 MMs, $10-15M depth, 99.9%+ uptime
- 150-250 active traders, $25-40M daily volume, 45-55% retention
- 3,000-5,000 retail MAU, $80-120M OI
- 3-5 partner integrations, 20-30% partner-driven volume
- **Token FDV:** $90-145M

**Home run (strong positioning):**
- 8-12 MMs, $20-30M depth, 99.95%+ uptime
- 400-600 active traders, $60-100M daily volume, 65-75% retention
- 10,000-15,000 retail MAU, $250-400M OI
- 10+ partner integrations, 40-50% partner-driven volume
- **Token FDV:** $220-365M

**So what for investors:** This raise funds 12-15 months of execution-focused GTM. If we hit "good enough" metrics, token FDV reaches $90-145M. If we hit "home run" metrics, token FDV reaches $220-365M. Future rounds are equity+token. Capital is allocated to prove liquidity first (Phase 1), then trader adoption (Phase 2), then retail scale (Phase 3)—each phase de-risks the next.

## Roadmap

Tier 1's rollout follows an execution-first, phased approach designed to establish deterministic market quality before scaling distribution. Each phase reinforces the next, building deep liquidity, measurable execution improvements, and durable adoption.

![Tier 1 GTM Roadmap](/images/exec-summary-roadmap.png)

<p class="text-center text-xs font-bold text-neutral-400 mt-8">
  Each phase includes points-based incentives tied to verifiable execution metrics. Incentives taper as organic liquidity and trading activity become self-sustaining.
