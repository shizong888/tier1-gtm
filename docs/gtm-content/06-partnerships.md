# Key Partnerships, Distribution Channels, and Growth Loops

Tier 1's partnerships are operational levers, not strategic narratives. Each partnership type maps to specific KPIs and phase-based GTM objectives.

## Liquidity Engine (Phase 1: Months 0-3)

**Partnership type:** Direct MM onboarding via BSO + institutional sales.

**Who:** 8-12 professional market makers (Jump, Wintermute, Flowdesk, etc.) + HFT shops requiring colocation.

**What we provide:**
- Physical colocation with <1ms latency
- Deterministic queue rules and transparent fee structures
- Pilot liquidity programs with tiered rebates

**What they provide:**
- Continuous two-sided quotes across 3-5 flagship markets
- $15M+ depth within 25bps of mid
- 99.9%+ uptime commitment

**Channel execution:**
- BSO warm intros to top 5 crypto MMs (months 0-1)
- Direct outreach to top 20 MMs via institutional sales (months 1-2)
- Pilot agreements signed pre-launch (month 2)

**KPIs:**
- 6+ MMs live at launch
- $15M+ depth across flagships
- <0.1% queue manipulation incidents
- 95%+ colocation uptime

**So what for GTM:** No MMs = no product. BSO partnership is the critical path. Target 3-4 signed agreements before public launch.

## Treasury and Incentive Allocation (All Phases)

**Partnership type:** Points programs tied to verifiable activity, not speculative volume.

**Who:** All participant groups (MMs, traders, retail, partners).

**What we provide:**
- Points based on sustained volume, liquidity provision, uptime
- FT1 allocation tied to long-term contribution
- Transparent on-chain verification

**What they provide:**
- Real trading activity and liquidity (not wash volume)
- Sustained participation (30+ days)
- Organic network growth through quality

**Channel execution:**
- Launch points dashboard showing real-time accrual (month 1)
- Publish incentive allocation framework (month 2)
- Taper incentives as organic liquidity stabilizes (months 12-18)

**KPIs:**
- Incentive efficiency: $ spent per $ of sustained liquidity
- 60%+ of points go to users active >30 days
- Incentive budget utilization tracking vs. plan
- Organic volume growth rate (month-over-month)

**So what for GTM:** Incentives verify contribution, not volume. Use points to reward real participation and align long-term contributors with protocol success.

## Institutional Connectivity and Settlement (Phase 1-2: Months 0-6)

**Partnership type:** Infrastructure providers enabling institutional access.

- Publish case studies with early institutional users (month 6)

**KPIs:**

**So what for GTM:** Institutions need trusted infrastructure. Connectivity + custody partnerships are table stakes for MM onboarding.

## Collateral, Margin, and Stablecoin Integration (Phase 2: Months 3-9)

**KPIs:**
