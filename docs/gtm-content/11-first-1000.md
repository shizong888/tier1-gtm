# Acquiring the First 1,000 Market Participants

Tier 1 defines its first 1,000 participants by market contribution, not vanity metrics. These early users establish liquidity, validate execution quality, and generate real trading data—forming the foundation for organic growth.

---

## Composition and Acquisition Targets

**Phase 1 (Months 0-3): 100 participants**
- 8-12 professional market makers and HFT shops
- 50-70 execution-sensitive active traders
- 20-30 power retail participants
- 5-10 early ecosystem partners (analytics, tooling)

**Phase 2 (Months 3-9): 600-1,000 participants**
- Retain 80%+ of Phase 1 users (churn <20%)
- Add 400-700 active traders via prop platforms and KOL campaigns
- Add 100-200 power retail via CEX migration programs
- Add 10-15 ecosystem partners (UIs, wallets, risk engines)

**Phase 3 (Months 9-12): 1,500-2,500+ participants**
- Retain 70%+ of Phase 2 users
- Add 500-1,000 retail traders via wallet integrations and referral schemes
- Expand ecosystem partners to 20-25

## Phase 1 — Liquidity and Execution Validation (Months 0-3)

**Focus:** Prove deterministic execution under real market conditions with professional liquidity.

**Acquisition channels:**
- BSO intros to top 5 crypto MMs (target: 3-4 signed agreements pre-launch)
- Direct institutional sales to top 20 MMs (target: 8-12 MMs live at launch)
- Invite-only access for 50 execution-sensitive traders (prop firms, quant funds)

**What success looks like:**
- 6+ MMs providing continuous two-sided quotes
- $15M+ depth within 25bps across BTC, ETH, SOL perps
- <10bps spreads on flagship markets (vs. 15-25bps on CEXs)
- $5M+ daily notional volume from early traders
- <0.1% queue manipulation or execution irregularities
- 95%+ colocation uptime

**What failure looks like:**
- <4 MMs live, spreads >15bps, depth <$10M
- MMs pull quotes due to infrastructure issues
- Trader churn >30% in first 30 days
- Execution quality worse than CEX benchmarks

**KPIs:**
- MM count: 6+
- Depth at top of book: $15M+
- Spreads: <10bps on majors
- Active traders: 50-70
- 30-day retention: 80%+
- Uptime: 99.9%+

**So what for GTM:** Phase 1 IS the product. Without professional liquidity and proven execution, there's nothing to sell to traders. BSO partnership is the critical path—delay launch if MM commitments aren't secured.

## Phase 2 — Active Trader Expansion (Months 3-9)

**Focus:** Validate execution improvements through measurable trader behavior and third-party proof.

**Acquisition channels:**
- Partner platforms: FTMO-equivalent prop trading programs (target: 100-150 traders)
- KOL campaigns: Execution-focused CT influencers with 50K+ followers (target: 2-3 campaigns, 50-100 traders each)
- CEX migration programs: Fee discounts + points multipliers for high-volume CEX traders (target: 50-80 traders)
- Direct outreach to competing venue power users (target: 30-50 traders)

**What success looks like:**
- 600-1,000 active traders generating $150-300M daily notional
- 60%+ retention (30-day cohort)
- Average slippage <15bps for $50K trades
- 70-80% of volume from institutional/active traders
- 20%+ of new signups from organic referrals
- Third-party execution audit shows 25%+ spread compression vs. CEXs

**What failure looks like:**
- <400 active traders, volume <$80M daily
- Retention <40%, slippage >25bps
- Traders report execution quality worse than CEXs
- Organic referrals <10% of signups

**KPIs:**
- Active traders: 600-1,000
- Daily notional volume: $150-300M
- 30-day retention: 60%+
- Slippage (50K trade): <15bps
- Institutional/active trader volume %: 70-80%
- Organic referrals: 20%+

**So what for GTM:** Phase 2 validates execution quality with third-party data AND establishes institutional volume dominance. A few hundred highly active traders drive majority of platform volume. Publish transparent execution dashboard, run KOL campaigns showcasing measurable improvements.

## Phase 3 — Retail Onboarding with Proven Market Quality (Months 9-12)

**Focus:** Scale access once markets demonstrably deliver institutional-grade execution.

**Acquisition channels:**
- Wallet integrations: MetaMask, Phantom (target: 200-300 signups/month per integration)
- DEX aggregators: 1inch, Matcha routing (target: 100-150 signups/month)
- Referral schemes: Tiered rewards for community advocates (target: 20%+ of signups)
- Partner UIs: Integration with top 3 perps platforms (target: 300-500 signups/month)

**What success looks like:**
- 1,000-2,000 monthly active retail traders (cumulative: 2,000-8,000)
- $400-600M daily open interest
- <2% unfair liquidations (vs. 8-12% CEX average)
- 50%+ of retail active beyond 90 days
- NPS >40
- 20-30% of total volume from retail
- 30%+ of retail volume routed via partner UIs

**What failure looks like:**
- <1,500 cumulative retail traders
- Open interest <$250M
- Liquidation fairness worse than CEXs
- 90-day retention <30%
- NPS <25

**KPIs:**
- Monthly active retail: 1,000-2,000
- Cumulative retail: 2,000-8,000
- Daily open interest: $400-600M
- Unfair liquidation rate: <2%
- 90-day retention: 50%+
- NPS: >40
- Retail volume share: 20-30%
- Partner-driven retail volume: 30%+

**So what for GTM:** Retail scales once execution is proven. Volume concentration in institutional traders (70-80%) means platform succeeds without massive retail headcount. Emphasize "HFTs provide liquidity here, not exit liquidity" narrative. Transparent liquidations + on-chain rules eliminate CEX discretion.

## Feedback Loop

Early MMs establish liquidity and execution credibility →
Credibility attracts execution-sensitive traders →
Traders validate quality through measurable fills →
Retail benefits from institutional-grade depth →
Volume increases, LP returns improve →
More MMs join, liquidity deepens →
Market quality compounds

**So what for GTM:** Sequencing is everything. MMs before traders, traders before retail, retail before ecosystem. Each phase proves value for the next. Track cohort retention ruthlessly—churn kills network effects.
