# Acquiring the First 1,000 Market Participants

Tier 1 defines its first 1,000 participants not by user count, but by market contribution. These early participants are selected for their ability to establish liquidity, validate execution quality, and generate real market data. This cohort forms the foundation of Tier 1's long-term trading ecosystem.

---

## Composition of the First 1,000

The initial cohort is intentionally skewed toward participants who directly improve market quality:

- Professional market makers and liquidity providers
- Active traders sensitive to execution quality and latency
- Power retail participants trading with meaningful frequency and size
- Early ecosystem partners building tooling and interfaces

This group is sufficient to produce tight spreads, sustainable funding dynamics, and credible execution benchmarks.

## Phase 1 — Liquidity and Execution Validation

**Focus:** Establish deterministic execution under real market conditions.

- Onboard core liquidity providers through colocation and low-latency access
- Launch a limited set of high-signal markets
- Incentives tied to depth, spread quality, uptime, and execution performance

**Outcome:**

Tier 1 proves execution quality and market stability before broad distribution.

---

## Phase 2 — Active Trader Expansion

**Focus:** Validate execution improvements through real trading behavior.

- Invite execution-sensitive traders and power retail
- Publish transparent execution and slippage metrics
- Reward sustained trading activity through points-based programs

**Outcome:**

Organic volume increases without degrading execution quality.

---

## Phase 3 — Retail Onboarding with Proven Market Quality

**Focus:** Expand access once markets are demonstrably healthy.

- Open access through trusted interfaces and partners
- Emphasize execution fairness and predictable liquidations
- Incentives favor productive participation over speculative churn

**Outcome:**

Retail traders enter deep, stable markets, improving retention and trust.

## Feedback Loop

Early liquidity establishes execution credibility →

Execution credibility attracts active traders →

Active trading improves market depth and data →

Retail participation reinforces volume and liquidity →

Market quality compounds, attracting the next cohort of participants

Tier 1's first 1,000 participants are not an adoption milestone. They are the minimum viable market required to prove that deterministic, institutional-grade execution works on-chain.
