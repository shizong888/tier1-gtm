# Expanding Reach via the Trading Ecosystem

Tier 1 scales through phase-sequenced distribution: MMs first (supply-side unlock), active traders second (validation), retail third (volume scale), partners throughout (amplification). Each group has specific acquisition channels, tactics, and KPIs.

<div class="gtm-cards-grid">

## Institutional Liquidity Providers (Phase 1: Months 0-3)

**Target:** 8-12 professional MMs and HFT shops requiring colocation and deterministic execution.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- BSO warm intros to top 5 crypto MMs (months 0-1)
- Direct institutional sales to top 20 MMs (months 1-2)
- Pilot liquidity programs with tiered fee rebates
- Pre-launch MM summits showcasing colocation infrastructure

**Value proposition:**
- Sub-1ms execution latency impossible on existing on-chain venues
- Deterministic queueing eliminates discretionary matching
- Transparent fee structures and verifiable on-chain fills

**KPIs:**
- 6+ MMs live at launch providing continuous quotes
- $15M+ depth within 25bps of mid
- <0.1% queue manipulation incidents
- 95%+ colocation uptime

**So what for GTM:** BSO partnership is the critical path—no MMs = no product. Target 3-4 signed agreements before public launch. Delay if commitments aren't secured.

## Active Traders and Power Retail (Phase 2: Months 3-9)

**Target:** 400-1,000 execution-sensitive traders seeking measurably better fills than CEXs. These traders drive 70-80% of platform volume.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Partner with funded prop platforms (FTMO equivalents): target 200-300 traders
- Run 2-3 KOL campaigns with execution-focused CT influencers (50K+ followers): target 100-200 traders per campaign
- Launch CEX migration program: fee discounts + 2x points for high-volume CEX traders (target: 100-150 traders)
- Direct outreach to power users on competing venues (target: 50-100 traders)
- Publish transparent execution dashboard showing spreads, slippage, depth vs. CEXs

**Value proposition:**
- 20-40% tighter spreads vs. CEXs
- 30-60% lower slippage for $50K trades
- Real-time execution metrics traders can verify independently
- Points tied to sustained volume, not wash trading

**KPIs:**
- 600-1,000 active traders generating $150-300M daily notional
- 60%+ 30-day retention
- <15bps average slippage for $50K trades
- 70-80% of total volume from institutional/active traders
- 20%+ of signups from organic referrals

**So what for GTM:** Active traders validate execution quality AND drive majority of volume. A few hundred highly active institutional traders are more valuable than thousands of casual retail users. Publish third-party audit in month 6 comparing Tier 1 vs. top 3 CEXs.

## Broader Retail Traders (Phase 3: Months 9-18)

**Target:** 2,000-8,000 retail traders seeking fair access to HFT-grade liquidity. Retail contributes 20-30% of platform volume.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Wallet integrations (MetaMask, Phantom): target 150-250 signups/month per integration
- DEX aggregator routing (1inch, Matcha): target 75-125 signups/month
- Referral schemes with tiered rewards: soft-launch with 20-30 advocates (month 6), public launch (month 9)
- Partner UIs (top 3 perps platforms): target 200-350 signups/month
- Educational content: "Why HFT liquidity benefits retail" narrative, transparent liquidation explainers

**Value proposition:**
- Same spreads as institutions (no two-tier pricing)
- <2% unfair liquidations vs. 8-12% CEX average
- Transparent on-chain rules eliminate discretionary execution
- "HFTs provide liquidity here, not exit liquidity"

**KPIs:**
- 2,000-8,000 monthly active retail traders
- $400-600M daily open interest
- <2% unfair liquidation rate
- 50%+ of retail active beyond 90 days
- NPS >40
- 20-30% of total volume from retail
- 30%+ of retail volume via partner UIs

**So what for GTM:** Retail scales once execution is proven. Volume concentration in institutional traders means platform succeeds without massive retail headcount. Launch wallet integrations month 9, activate referral schemes month 10. Emphasize transparent liquidations + on-chain fairness vs. CEX discretion.

## Ecosystem and Infra Partners (All Phases: Months 6-18)

**Target:** 20-25 partners across UIs, wallets, analytics, custody, and tooling.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Partner program launch (month 6) with co-marketing and shared points programs
- Direct BD to top 10 perps UIs and wallet providers
- Developer grants for analytics dashboards, trading bots, risk engines
- Integration support and technical resources
- Co-publish execution quality reports via partner platforms

**Value proposition:**
- High-quality execution data they can market to users
- Shared incentives tied to real user activity
- APIs/SDKs for seamless integration

**KPIs:**
- 5+ partner integrations live by month 12
- 30%+ of volume routed via partner UIs
- 1,000+ monthly signups from partner channels
- Partner NPS >50
- 3+ analytics integrations (Dune, Nansen) by month 12

**So what for GTM:** Partners amplify distribution without fragmenting liquidity. Prioritize integrations bringing high-intent users: prop platforms, execution-focused UIs, wallet providers with active trader bases.
