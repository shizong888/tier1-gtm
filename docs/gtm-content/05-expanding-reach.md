# Expanding Reach via the Trading Ecosystem

Tier 1 scales through phase-sequenced distribution: MMs first (supply-side unlock), active traders second (validation), retail third (volume scale), partners throughout (amplification). Each group has specific acquisition channels, tactics, and KPIs.

<div class="gtm-cards-grid">

## Institutional Liquidity Providers (Phase 1: Months 0-3)

**Target:** 8-12 professional MMs and HFT shops requiring colocation and deterministic execution.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- BSO warm intros to top 5 crypto MMs (months 0-1)
- Direct institutional sales to top 20 MMs (months 1-2)
- Pilot liquidity programs with tiered fee rebates
- Pre-launch MM summits showcasing colocation infrastructure

**Value proposition:**
- Sub-1ms execution latency impossible on existing on-chain venues
- Deterministic queueing eliminates discretionary matching
- Transparent fee structures and verifiable on-chain fills

**KPIs:**
- 6+ MMs live at launch providing continuous quotes
- $15M+ depth within 25bps of mid
- <0.1% queue manipulation incidents
- 95%+ colocation uptime

**So what for GTM:** BSO partnership is the critical path—no MMs = no product. Target 3-4 signed agreements before public launch. Delay if commitments aren't secured.

## Active Traders and Power Retail (Phase 2: Months 3-9)

**Target:** 200-500 execution-sensitive traders seeking measurably better fills than CEXs.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Partner with funded prop platforms (FTMO equivalents): target 100-150 traders
- Run 2-3 KOL campaigns with execution-focused CT influencers (50K+ followers): target 50-100 traders per campaign
- Launch CEX migration program: fee discounts + 2x points for high-volume CEX traders (target: 50-80 traders)
- Direct outreach to power users on competing venues (target: 30-50 traders)
- Publish transparent execution dashboard showing spreads, slippage, depth vs. CEXs

**Value proposition:**
- 20-40% tighter spreads vs. CEXs
- 30-60% lower slippage for $50K trades
- Real-time execution metrics traders can verify independently
- Points tied to sustained volume, not wash trading

**KPIs:**
- 300+ active traders generating $50M+ daily notional
- 60%+ 30-day retention
- <15bps average slippage for $50K trades
- 40%+ of volume from institutional sources
- 20%+ of signups from organic referrals

**So what for GTM:** Active traders validate execution quality. Publish third-party audit in month 6 comparing Tier 1 vs. top 3 CEXs. Use trader testimonials to build credibility for retail expansion.

## Broader Retail Traders (Phase 3: Months 9-18)

**Target:** 5,000-15,000 retail traders seeking fair access to HFT-grade liquidity.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Wallet integrations (MetaMask, Phantom): target 200-300 signups/month per integration
- DEX aggregator routing (1inch, Matcha): target 100-150 signups/month
- Referral schemes with tiered rewards: soft-launch with 20-30 advocates (month 6), public launch (month 9)
- Partner UIs (top 3 perps platforms): target 300-500 signups/month
- Educational content: "Why HFT liquidity benefits retail" narrative, transparent liquidation explainers

**Value proposition:**
- Same spreads as institutions (no two-tier pricing)
- <2% unfair liquidations vs. 8-12% CEX average
- Transparent on-chain rules eliminate discretionary execution
- "HFTs provide liquidity here, not exit liquidity"

**KPIs:**
- 8,000+ monthly active retail traders
- $200M+ daily open interest
- <2% unfair liquidation rate
- 50%+ of retail active beyond 90 days
- NPS >40
- 30%+ of volume via partner UIs

**So what for GTM:** Retail scales once execution is proven. Launch wallet integrations month 9, activate referral schemes month 10. Emphasize transparent liquidations + on-chain fairness vs. CEX discretion.

## Ecosystem and Infra Partners (All Phases: Months 6-18)

**Target:** 20-25 partners across UIs, wallets, analytics, custody, and tooling.

**Acquisition tactics:**
- Partner program launch (month 6) with co-marketing and shared points programs
- Direct BD to top 10 perps UIs and wallet providers
- Developer grants for analytics dashboards, trading bots, risk engines
- Integration support and technical resources
- Co-publish execution quality reports via partner platforms

**Value proposition:**
- High-quality execution data they can market to users
- Shared incentives tied to real user activity
- APIs/SDKs for seamless integration

**KPIs:**
- 5+ partner integrations live by month 12
- 30%+ of volume routed via partner UIs
- 1,000+ monthly signups from partner channels
- Partner NPS >50
- 3+ analytics integrations (Dune, Nansen) by month 12

**So what for GTM:** Partners amplify distribution without fragmenting liquidity. Prioritize integrations bringing high-intent users: prop platforms, execution-focused UIs, wallet providers with active trader bases.
